This is my custom vimrc!

In order for this to work if you want to clone you are going to need <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>

This is originally based off of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE">ThePrimeagen's Neovim 0 to LSP video</a>, however this is configured for a QWERTY keyboard and also has fixes for Mason as his repo was deprecated.
